### variable declaration try to use:

1. Camel Case
2. start with lower case
3. don't use keywords like name or new
4. never use special characters
5. if real const let all uppercase
6. be declarative, myFirstJob instead of job1
7. you can use, `let`, `const` and `var` (depracated).

### variable types:

- numbers, strings, booleans, undefined `let children;`, Null.
- BigInt: larger integers than number type can hold.

```javascript
// undefined be like
let year;
console.log(year);
console.log(typeof year);

// output:
//undefined
//undefined
```

```javascript
// null be like
console.log(null);
console.log(typeof null);

//output
//null
//object
```

### general:

1. Variable Types can change for example start as int and then be string.
2. typeof is an operator same as `+` and `-`.
3. the console has access in real time to all the varibales int running script in vs code.
4. for documentation use `https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/`.
5. It's preferred to use `const` in declarations.
6.

```javascript
// if else control structure be like
if(){

} else {

}
```

7. `NaN` -> an invalid nubmer.
8. Conversion and Coercion -> Conversion is manually type casting a value Coercion is java scripts work it, Number is the dominant in subtraction and String is the dominant in addition.

### Strings

1. you can use `` to just like f strings in python.

```javascript
`this is string concatinated with an integer ${5}`;
```

2. you can either print multiple lines by adding `\n\` in a normal string or simple press return inside a `` string.
